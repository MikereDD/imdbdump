I forked this out of fun and wanting to add it to an NFO file creator I put together.

Plans on future add-ons.
1. thumbnail grabber to fetch the title poster images on request.
2. merge this with miNfo.
3. plot output rearranged.
4. add option to strip color when used with miNfo to create .nfo files.
