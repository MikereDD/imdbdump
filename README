Usage
=========

   imdbdump [option] [arg]

   Options : 
   -v : gives the version of the script
   -h : shows the help page
   -t [arg] : Pass the movie title as argument. It is recommended to quote the name as shown in the example below 

   Example : 
   imdbdump -t "fistful of dollars"

small things I've changed.
1. imdbdump uses Elinks http://elinks.or.cz/ instead of lynx.
2. rating bar with asterix for the stars.
3. using `which executable` instead of direct path.
