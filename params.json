This project uses few bash shell commands to fetch details of the movie you throw at it and present it in pure text, so that you don't have to leave your favorite shell. \r\n\r\nThis project at present is at its 4th version. There is an official Arch linux package out there in AUR, so those who use Arch Linux can just grab that. Also there are few rpms available for fedora, built by Dipu. \r\n\r\nWe do have plans to create a gtk version of this application using python. Also improve the command line version along with it. \r\n\r\nThats all for now.","tagline":"Tool to search and get details about movies "}
